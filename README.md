# M W Pattern Trading Robot

This is a code for a trading robot that is designed to identify and analyze M or W patterns in the price chart of a forex trading pair. The robot will place buy or sell orders based on the detected pattern.

## How it works

The code uses the following logic to identify and analyze M or W patterns:

1. The code imports necessary libraries for trading operations.
2. The code defines two constants, `STOP_LOSS` and `TAKE_PROFIT`, which represent the stop loss and take profit levels for the trading orders.
3. The function `identifyMWPattern()` is responsible for identifying and analyzing M or W patterns.
4. Inside the function, there are two conditional statements to check if either an M pattern or a W pattern is detected.
5. If an M pattern is detected, a sell order is placed using the `TradeOrder` class. Any existing positions are closed before opening the sell order.
6. If a W pattern is detected, a buy order is placed using the `TradeOrder` class. Any existing positions are closed before opening the buy order.
7. The functions `isMPattern()` and `isWPattern()` are placeholders for the actual logic to check if an M or W pattern is present. These functions should be implemented separately to analyze swing highs and swing lows in the price chart.
8. The `OnTick()` function is the entry point of the program. It calls the `identifyMWPattern()` function to check if an M or W pattern is detected. If a pattern is detected, appropriate action is taken based on the pattern. If no pattern is detected, normal trading operations continue.
